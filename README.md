# hello-world
just the first test using github
==================
errrrrr,trying to figure out how it working
So far, my understanding is :
this branch supposed to be a extra copy of the master copy so that programmers can do whatever they want here without damage on the orginal copy?
not 100% sure of that, just keep doing what it said in guide, I should be fine :)
